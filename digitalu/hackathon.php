                            UBC mobile application hackathon on December 3rd. Spend the day dreaming up and building a new mobile application or
                            service to enhance the UBC experience… What kind of mobile app would
                            make UBC a much better place for you?</p>

                                contest to win up to $5000! We are working on cool prizes for the best
                                hacks as well.

                        If you’re looking for a partner to co-develop something, please get there by
                        9:30 AM so you have time to mingle and hook up.

                        We’ll get started at 10AM, with a few words from people at MAGIC while
                        you have some of the coffee and donuts we’re providing. Then someone
                        will present some info on Digital U and the Kurogo platform, and we’ll get

                        to work.

                        Around 12:30, we’ll get some lunch, which you can help yourselves to.

                        At 5:00, everyone stops coding. After a quick bio break, each team that
                        wants to will have five minutes to present their work to the group.

                                <h3>What can I code in?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    You can build your application on anything you want, as long as it’s an
                                    app or service for UBC. Since m.ubc.ca is a Kurogo-based system we
                                    encourage people to consider building Kurogo modules, but this is not a
                                    requirement.

                                    Experienced mobile web, iOS and Android developers will be on hand to
                                    help.

                                    We will supply a shared LAMP server for users to create mobile web
                                    services using PHP and MySQL and the Kurogo framework. If you want
                                    to use other mobile web or native platforms (Ruby, native iOS, Android,
                                    PhoneGap), you will need to find and install your own tools and server
                                    hosts. We suggest getting this ready in advance.

                                    We’ll do our best to match people up
                                    beforehand. You can also try to find a partner at the event itself -- arrive early
                                    to leave some time for mingling.

                                <p>
                                    The hackathon is mainly aimed at developers. But if you have a good idea,
                                    and you’re not sure you can build it on your own, let us know. We can try
                                    to match you up with a developer. Similarly, if you’re a coder but you’re open to working with a less-technical
                                    partner for the day, drop us a line.

                                <p>
                                    We’re hoping that pairs of developers work on something—we want to
                                    avoid large groups of people coding a single project, as (in our experience)
                                    this leads to scope creep and miscommunication that means the project
                                    doesn’t get finished.
                                </p>

                                    You can download development environments, a LAMP setup with Kurogo,
                                    iOS and Android online. All of these platforms have good documentation.

                                    You should come armed with a notebook or two, plus anything else you
                                    need to build an app (i.e. an iPhone or Android if it’s mobile; books; etc.)
                                    We’ll provide power and a wireless LAN (UBC), as well as desks and food.

                                    You do, unless you’re using something that belongs to someone else.
                                    We’d like to make a few screenshots of promising projects, which we can
                                    share with folks in the UBC community, but that’s up to you. We’ll also be
                                    taking pictures during the event; we assume that’s OK.

                                    We do encourage all Hackathon participants to enter their code into the Digital*U contest,
                                    but it's not mandatory. If you produce something that you'd like to enter into Digital*U,
