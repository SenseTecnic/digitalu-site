                            We're looking for creative individuals and groups on campus to champion innovative ideas.
                            Win cool prizes by proposing a new mobile app or service that could dramatically enhance the UBC experience.
                            It can be for fun, function or achieving UBC’s global mission. What kind of mobile app would make UBC a much better place for you?
                            Winning entries will be vying for a grand prize of $5000, a second-place prize of $3000, plus cool devices, fame and fortune.
                            The best ideas will find their way into labs, design studios, hackathons and - yes - into reality!

                                    (Students, alumni, faculty, and so on.) If you do have questions or concerns about this, however,
                                    you can shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:digitalu@magic.ubc.ca">digitalu@magic.ubc.ca</a> explaining
                                    your situation.

                                <p>
                                    All submissions will become the exclusive property of UBC to display, distribute, develop and apply as it so chooses.
                                    Applicants will be invited to become beneficial participants in the further refinement and development of their ideas,
                                    should that take place. Applicants may optionally choose to develop their ideas as their own ventures in conjuntion with the UBC
                                    MAGIC Lab and/or within UBC programs such as entrepreneurship@UBC.
