                            We're looking for creative individuals and groups on campus to champion innovative ideas.
                            Win cool prizes by proposing a new mobile app or service that could dramatically enhance the UBC experience.
                            It can be for fun, function or achieving UBC’s global mission. What kind of mobile app would make UBC a much better place for you?
                            Winning entries will be vying for a grand prize of $5000, a second-place prize of $3000, plus cool devices, fame and fortune.
                            The best ideas will find their way into labs, design studios, hackathons and - yes - into reality!
